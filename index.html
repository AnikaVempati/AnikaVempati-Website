        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Anika Vempati and I am currently a first year student at the University of California Riverside. I currently have no experience as a management consultant however I am deeply interested in entering this exciting career field. The field of business has always fascinated me and I am currently studying towards a bachelor of science degree in Business Administration in order to begin a professional career in world of business, especially management consulting. I am looking forward to beginning an internship with a consulting firm and gaining hands-on experience in this career field. Through internships, I hope to become well acquainted with the profession as well as learn from and make connections with individuals who are already in the profession. I also look forward to learning about whatâ€™s expected from me as a management consultant before entering into the professional workforce after graduating college.<br><br>

        As a first year business student at the Unviersity of California, Riverside I have had the opportunity to explore various career paths in business and broaden my knowledge on the type of jobs currently available. The classes I am currently taking reflect the knowledge I will need to acquire and apply as a management consultant, such as Introduction to Business, Personal Finance, and Introduction to Computer Science. I have also participated in and attended seminars where I learned further learned about various career fields, such as finance, consulting, accounting, marketing, human resources, etc. Of all these fields, management consulting is the most appealing career choice for me since it incorporates all the elements of business I am deeply interested in. For example, helping a company or organization achieve their organizational goals to the best of their ability has always been a interest of mine. Helping people and groups find more efficient and effective ways to perform a task has always been something that I am good at. Skills such as process analysis, technology implementation, strategy development, and operational improvement services have always been skills that I value a lot and am interested in forming and executing.<br><br>

        In the future, I hope to expand my knowledge and skills in management consulting by joining and participating in various clubs or organizations both on campus and off campus. I am looking forward to joining clubs such as Women in Business, Management Consulting Association, Finance Club, Pre-Business Association, Economics Association, and more. I hope to gain hands-on experience in this field by joining various internships in several companies. As a management consultant, I hope to work with clients both domestically and internationally. I hope to help clients solve complicated problems in all fields within their company, including in business, organizational, and operational fields. I hope to help them find and improve their company procedures to work more effectively and efficiently. I hope to provided with the opportunity to work for well known and established consulting firms in order to become familiar with consulting and become an expert in the field. These consulting firms include McKinsey and Company, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, Oliver Wyman, Bain and Company, and many more.
